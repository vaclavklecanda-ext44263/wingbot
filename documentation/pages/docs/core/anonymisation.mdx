# Anonymisation

There a three tiers of anonymisation

- **pattern anonymisation** (enabled by default)
- **expected input anonymisation** (when bot asks for something sensitive)
- **confident inputs (passwords)**

## Pattern anonymisation

**Every** user input is anonymized with a pattern replacement.

Every chatbot built with `wingbot-cli` has a file (`bot/anonymize.js`) with predefined regular expressions:

- `@EMAIL` - email addresses
- `@PHONE` - phone numbers
- `@CODE` - alphanumeric codes (numbers combined with letters)

All these patters are used when storing:

- **conversation history** (`textFilter` option at `BotApp` class)
- **reporting**
    - Google Analytics (`onAction.js`)
    - Table Storage

> If it's necessary, it's possible to disable the pattern anonymisation, but it's not recommended.
## Expected input anonymisation

It's possible to anonymize a user input, which follows after an interaction

- disables the NLP on user input
- replaces text content of incoming request before
storing it at ChatLogStorage using a `confidentInputFilter`
- `req.isConfidentInput()` will return true

After processing the user input, next requests will be processed as usual,

```javascript
const { Router } = require('wingbot');
const bot = new Router();
bot.use('start', (req, res) => {
    // evil question
    res.text('Give me your CARD NUMBER :D')
        .expected('received-card-number')
        .expectedConfidentInput();
});
bot.use('received-card-number', (req, res) => {
    const cardNumber = req.text();
    // raw card number
    req.isConfidentInput(); // true
    res.text('got it')
        .setState({ cardNumber });
```
## Confidential inputs (password)
When using the chatbot with the Wingbot's web chat, it's possible to use a special input type, which **hides inserted content immediately after it is submitted**
```javascript
res.expectedInput(res.ExpectedInputTypes.TYPE_PASSWORD);
```
