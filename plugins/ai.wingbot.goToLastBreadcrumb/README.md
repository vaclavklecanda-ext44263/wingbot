> Breadcrumbs allows you to track some particular flow and make user able to return to previous steps in the flow.

This is a example of using breadcrubms:

1. Put breadcrumbs at checkpoints - interaction, where each step begins
2. Allow user to get back to the previous step using a **Go to last breadcrumb** plugin.
