> This plugin helps you to drive user back to previous interaction.

If the previous interaction exists and it's not a fallback or the same interaction, where the plugin is, the bot will go back and stops executing this interaction.

If not, the bot will continue in execution of this interaction, so you can handle situation.

It's useful to  it use **Show when there is a way back** condition, so you don't have to worry about handling the situation, when there's no way to go back.
