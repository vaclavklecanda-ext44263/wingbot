> This plugin allows bot to just **send no response**

This is useful, when you want to override the default behavior of wingbot - because **when there is no response message in an interaction, users request will fall into a fallback.

Following example shows, how to use this plugin to keep following users response without reaction. Second users attempt will be processed as usual.
